Roleplay telegram game engine with ChatGPT backbone

### Several assumptions...

1. You got your GameMaster bot token from BotFather and You have Open AI acc. These two parameters must be specified in docker-compose.yml

3. You up local StableDffusion (https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and set it entry-point URL in g_master/SD_api.py

4. You has PROXY in local and set it URL in PROXY variable in g_master/main.py

if not... if not, fix it yourself! :)
